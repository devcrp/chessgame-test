# Chess Game â™˜

Playing aroung trying to design a supple model for a chess game application, it's being developed following DDD and TDD methodologies. The state of the game is managed on the server side by a .NET Core API, client side is going to be built using ReactJS.

**Any feedback is more than welcome! :)**
